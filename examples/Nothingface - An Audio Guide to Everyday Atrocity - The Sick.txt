[Verse_1]
Scratch the tears in for good...
Sadist...
Feels good...
Life can't hurt on tv...
Godspeed...
Lucky now...
When he grabs your hand, do you lick again?
But the taste has changed, flesh remains.
[end]

[Chorus]
See what you go through...
With bleeding eyes...
Got what you came for...
When hate is blind...
[end]

[Refrain x4]
You told me not to lie!
[end]

[Verse_2]
Anger persists to drown...
Love it...
Loathes you...
Say your knife just won't kill...
Try hard...
Want it now...
When the taste has changed, do you rest your face?
No eyes will close, the hole grows.
[end]

<Chorus>

<Refrain x8>

--Instrumental Section--

<Refrain x8>

[Coda x9]
The start of new days...
Has nothing changed...
The sick knows no pain...
[end]
